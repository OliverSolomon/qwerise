**Q We Rise Network Profile**             

**About**

Q We Rise Network is a Feminist, Kenyan-based organization founded in 2023 by young Intersex, Transgender, Non-Binary, and Lesbian, Bisexual, & Queer (ITGNC & LBQ) individuals who have experienced the deep harms of structural violence, discriminatory laws, and social exclusion. Grounded in principles of bodily autonomy, collective liberation, and healing justice, our aim is to advance gender equity, mental wellness, and access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for ITGNC and LBQ communities.

We center communal care as a radical act of resistance and resilience using art, music, film, and sports as culturally rooted tools for expression, healing, and civic education. Our work is anchored in intersectional feminist values, prioritizing psychosocial support, economic empowerment, and advocacy as essential to collective liberation.

**Mission**

To empower ITGNC and LBQ individuals through Rights-Based Advocacy, inclusive SRHR Education, Economic Justice, and Creative Expression that centers healing and communal care.

**Vision**

To create a world where ITGNC and LBQ individuals are valued, respected, and empowered to live in their full, authentic selves free from oppression and held in communities rooted in care, dignity and justice.

**Core values**

**Radical joy and resistance \-** We embrace joy as a radical act of defiance and healing. Our resistance is rooted in hope, community, and the celebration of who we are.

**Creativity and expression** \- We honor art, storytelling, and culture as powerful tools to reclaim our voices and spark social change.

**Accountability** \- We are committed to transparency, responsibility and ethical action in our work.

**Intersectionality \-** We recognize intersecting systems of power and center those most impacted, committing to equity and inclusion in all we do.

**Bodily autonomy \-** We uphold everyone’s right to their body, identity, and life free from coercion, stigma, or violence. 

**Collective Liberation \-** We believe none of us are free until all of us are free. Our struggles are connected, and so is our liberation.

**Q We Rise Programs** 

**Advocacy and awareness creation**

* Q We Rise Network is committed to advancing the rights, visibility, and dignity of ITGNC and LBQ individuals through intersectional advocacy and inclusive community programs. We work in solidarity with civil society, grassroots movements, and key stakeholders to ensure our voices are centered in decision-making spaces. As part of our broader advocacy and awareness efforts, we are launching the Intersex Sports Program that is a community informed initiative that uses  sports to challenge stigma, promote inclusion, and empower intersex individuals, particularly in Nairobi’s informal settlements.

**Economic Empowerment**

* Q We Rise Network is committed to the economic empowerment of ITGNC and LBQ individuals through creative, skills-based programs that build financial independence and nurture talent. Our Leather Craft Training and Marketing Program equips women, girls, intersex, transgender, and non-binary persons with practical skills in leatherwork and entrepreneurship. Additionally, the Q We Rise Podcast Studio – DJ Training Program opens doors for ITGNC and LBQ youth in the music and entertainment industry. It provides a safe and affirming professional DJ and podcasting space to grow creatively and holistically

**Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR)**

* Q We Rise Network prioritizes the urgent need for accessible, inclusive, and affirming Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) services for our constituents. This program focuses on dismantling the systemic and societal barriers that prevent our communities from accessing essential healthcare. At the core of the program is a community and human rights-centered approach that strengthens personal agency by:  
1. Providing community education on SRHR and bodily autonomy,  
2. Facilitating safe space dialogues to reduce stigma and promote informed decision-making,  
3. Establishing and improving referral pathways to affirming health services.

**Storytelling and Documenting**

1. **Queers Got Talent program**

Queers Got Talent is an annual program by Q We Rise, launched in 2023 with the support of Hivos under the Free to Be Me initiative. The event offers a safe, affirming space for expression and aims to grow beyond Kenya into broader African and global platforms.

2. **The Art of EveryBody**

It was first launched in August 2024, a powerful celebration of queer identity, body diversity, and self-expression. In partnership with visual artist queer\_hemut, the event featured an art exhibition, film screening, panel discussion, and live performances. The event's core goal highlights the lived experiences of ITGNC and LBQ  artists, aiming to spark political dialogue on body acceptance, transitioning, and SRHR needs and gaps, which affirms the role of art in healing, resistance, and the power of documenting our experiences.

**Holistic wellbeing for individuals and communities**

* Our work is grounded in the healing justice frameworks, which understands that healing cannot happen in isolation; it must also address the social, political, and historical wounds our communities carry. We create and curate safe spaces and spaces of care for our mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical wellbeing while also challenging the systems that cause us harm. Through peer-led support circles, and community rituals, we promote holistic healing rooted in African values of ubuntu \- solidarity and shared care within communities.

**Approaches & Impact**

Over the past two years, Q We Rise Network has made transformative strides in advancing the rights, visibility, and wellbeing of ITGNC, and LBQ individuals in Kenya. Through strategic partnerships and a community-centered approach, we’ve reached over 300 individuals directly.

The community centered approaches we have facilitated different and beneficial collaborations that have facilitated safe space dialogues, 3 creative expression events, that are tailored for ITGNC and LBQ youth. Impactful partnerships with organisations like *HIVOS*  and *Feminists in Kenya* marks a bold step in reimagining the fight against femicide through a non-binary feminist lens. Together, we push narratives that center all bodies impacted by gender-based views and violence that are often excluded from mainstream feminist movements.

Additionally, our collaboration with *queer Hemut,* a queer visual artist, exemplifies our holistic wellbeing model blending art,and activism. Through projects like *The Art of Everybody*, we’ve curated healing spaces that validate queer experiences, celebrate diverse bodies, and address systemic exclusion in both health and cultural spaces.

This holistic wellbeing model has facilitated us to hold 3 community wellness events centering healing justice, and care.
