## **Our Programs**

### **Queers Got Talent**

**Queers Got Talent** is an annual arts and advocacy program that creates safe, visible, and empowering platforms for queer and gender-diverse artists in Kenya. Through performance, storytelling, and creative expression, QGT challenges harmful stereotypes, counters anti-rights narratives, and amplifies the voices of marginalized communities.

#### **Edition 3:Africanizing our Queer Cultures** 

The **third edition of Queers Got Talent** was held under the theme **“Africanizing our queer cultures,”** recognizing creativity as a powerful tool to counter anti-rights movements targeting LGBTQI+ and intersex persons in Kenya.

This edition intentionally centered:

* Queer, trans, non-binary, and intersex artists

* Art as a form of political expression and community healing

Through music, spoken word, dance, visual art, and storytelling, We use our talents to reclaim spaces, affirm identity, and resist policies and ideologies that threaten bodily autonomy and human rights.

Queers Got Talent continues to serve as both an artistic showcase and a movement-building space where talent meets activism, and visibility becomes power.

**Intersex Programs**

Our **Intersex Programs** are designed to increase visibility, promote bodily autonomy, and advocate for inclusive healthcare, mental well-being, and social justice for intersex persons. Rooted in lived experiences, our work challenges systemic harm while creating spaces for healing, empowerment, and leadership.

We implement our programs across **grassroots, national, and global platforms**, using both online and offline approaches to ensure intersex voices are heard, protected, and amplified.

### **Intersex Awareness Day**

Observed through public education activities and powerful visual campaigns using Intersex Awareness Day, serves as a critical moment to spotlight intersex realities and demand dignity and rights.

The program focuses on:

* **Challenging stigma, myths, and harmful medical practices**, including non-consensual interventions

* **Centering intersex voices** through storytelling, advocacy, and community-led dialogue

Through digital campaigns, community outreach, and storytelling, we create awareness **online, globally, and within grassroots spaces**, ensuring intersex narratives are visible beyond single-day commemorations.

### **Empowerment & Opportunities for Intersex Persons**

Beyond awareness, our Intersex Programs intentionally create **empowerment opportunities** for intersex persons by:

* Supporting leadership, advocacy, and storytelling initiatives

* Creating platforms for skills-building and economic empowerment

* Strengthening safe spaces that foster confidence, resilience, and collective power

By combining awareness, advocacy, and empowerment, we work towards a future where intersex persons can live with autonomy, dignity, and equal access to healthcare and opportunities.

#### **Intersex Access to Health Program**

This program addresses the systemic barriers intersex persons face when accessing healthcare. It focuses on:

* Awareness of intersex-inclusive and ethical healthcare

* Challenging non-consensual medical interventions

* Advocating for respectful, informed, and rights-based health services

The program also engages healthcare providers and community members to promote dignity and informed consent.
